An iOS app I built that allows you to track and favourite your GitHub followers. I built this app to learn the basics of UIKit.

This project is an iOS app built with UIKit that fetches and displays GitHub followers using the GitHub API. It supports search and it also allows users to favorite followers for easy access later. The app follows the MVC (Model-View-Controller) pattern to keep the code organized and maintainable.

### What I Learned

While building this app, I deepened my understanding of working with UIKit and handling API requests using URLSession. I learned how to efficiently manage data fetching and improve performance by caching data locally to reduce unnecessary API calls. Implementing memory management techniques like using weak self in closures was also key to preventing retain cycles and improving the app's performance. Additionally, I got hands-on experience in following the MVC design pattern, which helped me keep the project structured and scalable.
